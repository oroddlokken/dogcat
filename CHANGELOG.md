# CHANGELOG

## 0.7.0

### Multi-team collaboration

Parallel branch work on `.dogcats/` no longer breaks on merge.

**What's new:**

- **Custom JSONL merge driver** — auto-resolves most merge conflicts. Run `dcat git setup` to install it.
- **Branch-safe compaction** — auto-compaction only runs on main/master, preventing merge conflicts from both branches compacting.
- **`dcat git` subcommands** — `dcat git setup` (install merge driver), `dcat git check` (verify config), `dcat git guide` (integration docs).
- **Deep data validation in `dcat doctor`** — checks field integrity, referential integrity, and circular dependencies.
- **Post-merge concurrent edit detection** — `dcat doctor --post-merge` warns when a merge silently resolved same-issue edits via last-write-wins.
