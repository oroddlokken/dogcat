Demo data doesn't look like real data.\n2. **Operator attribution** - Manually sets created_by/updated_by/closed_by instead of relying on CLI auto-detection from git config.\n3. **No reference validation** - CLI validates parent, duplicate_of, and dependency targets exist before creating. Demo bypasses this.\n4. **Comments injected directly** - Passes comments list directly via storage.update(), bypassing the proper comment-adding path.\n5. **No dependency pre-validation** - CLI checks dependency targets exist before issue creation (fail-fast). Demo calls storage.add_dependency() directly.\n\nThe demo should exercise the same code paths as real usage so it can catch bugs in the CLI layer and produce realistic-looking data.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"post@rykroken.net","parent":null,"labels":["tech-debt","testing"],"external_ref":null,"design":null,"acceptance":null,"notes":null,"close_reason":null,"created_at":"2026-02-08T00:49:39.068656+01:00","created_by":"post@rykroken.net","updated_at":"2026-02-08T00:49:39.068693+01:00","updated_by":null,"closed_at":null,"closed_by":null,"deleted_at":null,"deleted_by":null,"delete_reason":null,"original_type":null,"comments":[],"duplicate_of":null,"metadata":{}}

All intermediate append-only records (status changes, priority updates, reassignments, etc.) are discarded.\n\n2. **Remaining open issues**: After removing archived issues from memory, `_save()` is called which compacts the main `issues.jsonl` file — rewriting it with only current state. This destroys the append-only event history for all surviving issues too.\n\n**Expected behavior**: Archive should preserve the full append-only event log for archived issues in the archive file, and should not compact away the history of open issues that remain in the main file.\n\n**Root cause**: `_save()` (storage.py) always does a full rewrite.
