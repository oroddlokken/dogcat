# CHANGELOG

## 0.7.3

- **Git health checks in standard `dcat prime`** — git integration checks now run by default (previously required `--opinionated`). Skipped when `git_tracking = false` in config.
- **`dcat init --no-git`** — initializes a dogcat repo with git tracking disabled: sets `git_tracking = false` and adds `.dogcats/` to `.gitignore`.

## 0.7.2

- **Merge driver is now a `dcat` subcommand** — replaced the separate `dcat-merge-jsonl` script with `dcat git merge-driver`, eliminating PATH/venv issues. `dcat git check` now validates the exact driver command.

## 0.7.1

- **`dcat prime --opinionated`** — new flag that adds prescriptive workflow guidelines and runs inline git health checks with actionable fix suggestions.

## 0.7.0

### Multi-team collaboration

Parallel branch work on `.dogcats/` no longer breaks on merge.

**What's new:**

- **Custom JSONL merge driver** — auto-resolves most merge conflicts. Run `dcat git setup` to install it.
- **Branch-safe compaction** — auto-compaction only runs on main/master, preventing merge conflicts from both branches compacting.
- **`dcat git` subcommands** — `dcat git setup` (install merge driver), `dcat git check` (verify config), `dcat git guide` (integration docs).
- **Deep data validation in `dcat doctor`** — checks field integrity, referential integrity, and circular dependencies.
- **Post-merge concurrent edit detection** — `dcat doctor --post-merge` warns when a merge silently resolved same-issue edits via last-write-wins.
