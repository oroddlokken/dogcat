The options considered:\n\n- **Anthropic Token Counting API** — exact but requires API key, not suitable for unit tests\n- **ctoc** (grohan.co, Feb 2026) — reverse-engineered ~96% accuracy offline, but brand new and risky as dependency\n- **tiktoken** (OpenAI) — wrong tokenizer entirely, Claude counts differ by 20-50%\n- **Character-based heuristic** — zero dependencies, conservative estimate\n\nWe chose a simple character-based tokenizer: chars / 4 ≈ tokens. This is intentionally conservative — it over-counts compared to real Claude tokenization because:\n\n1. Claude uses BPE which merges common multi-char sequences into single tokens\n2. Whitespace sequences (1-16 spaces, tabs, newlines) are each single tokens in Claude\n3. The ctoc blog showed that even a greedy longest-match estimator over-segments vs the real API\n4. For English prose (which dcat prime output mostly is), accuracy is in the 95-99% range\n\nClaude's vocabulary is ~36,495 tokens (per ctoc research), much smaller than OpenAI's 200k. The smaller vocab means slightly more splitting, but BPE still merges common patterns efficiently.\n\nSince our estimator over-counts, if the test passes at 1500 tokens, the real Claude token count is safely below that.\n\n## Implementation\n\n- Add MAX_PRIME_TOKENS = 1500 to constants.py\n- Add a simple token estimation helper (chars / 4)\n- Test runs dcat prime in a temp git repo where all health checks pass\n- Assert estimated token count <= MAX_PRIME_TOKENS"}},"title":"Add token limit test for dcat prime output"}
